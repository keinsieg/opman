# opman

opman is an open-source download manager built on top of [aria2c], with optional [yt-dlp] integration and [ffmpeg] support for media handling.

- Queue management (start, pause, resume, cancel)  
- Classic UI inspired by Windows 2000/XP  
- Optional video/audio merging and conversion with ffmpeg  
- Firefox extension for link capture  
- yt-dlp integration as an add-on, not core
